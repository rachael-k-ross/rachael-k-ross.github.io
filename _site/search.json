    "text": "About\nI am an epidemiologist with training and research experience in pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference. Broadly, my research aims to develop and apply novel quantitative methods to advance evidence-based clinical care and improve health care delivery. In my postodctoral fellowship, I work with Dr. Kara Rudolph of Columbia and Dr.Elizabeth Stuart of Johns Hopkins University on their grant, Design and analysis advances to improve generalizability of clinical trials for treatment opioid use disorder (R01DA056407). \nI completed a PhD in Epidemiology with a Minor in Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health under the mentorship of Dr. Steve Cole in 2023. My dissertation research focused on methods for missing data and measurement error in a causal inference framework. Previously, I completed an MPH at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health in 2011 and worked at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness (now Clinical Futures) under the mentorship of Dr. Jeff Gerber, 2011-2018. My reseach at CHOP supported and informed Antimicrobial Stewardship efforts, which are patient safety and quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing antimicrobial overuse to improve clinical outcomes and combat antimicrobial resistance."
