## About

I am an epidemiologist with training and research experience in pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference. Broadly, my research aims to develop and apply novel quantitative methods to advance evidence-based clinical care and improve health care delivery. In my postodctoral fellowship, I work with [Dr. Kara Rudolph](https://kararudolph.github.io/) of Columbia and [Dr.Elizabeth Stuart](https://www.elizabethstuart.org/) of Johns Hopkins University on their grant, [Design and analysis advances to improve generalizability of clinical trials for treatment opioid use disorder (R01DA056407)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/6RyGc9zdVEawgTj62h-FoQ/project-details/10701751). <br>

I completed a PhD in Epidemiology with a Minor in Biostatistics at the [University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Steve Cole](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/stephen-r-cole-phd/) in 2023. My dissertation research focused on methods for missing data and measurement error in a causal inference framework. Previously, I completed an MPH at [Emory University Rollins School of Public Health](https://sph.emory.edu/) in 2011 and worked at the [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness (now Clinical Futures)](https://clinicalfutures.research.chop.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Jeff Gerber](https://www.research.chop.edu/people/jeffrey-s-gerber), 2011-2018. My reseach at CHOP supported and informed Antimicrobial Stewardship efforts, which are patient safety and quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing antimicrobial overuse to improve clinical outcomes and combat antimicrobial resistance.
